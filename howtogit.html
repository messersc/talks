# Agenda
.large[
* version control systems (we will focus on git, mercurial is similar)
* concepts (repositories, commiting, pushing, merging, pulling, ...)
* github
* example1: JAMM Galaxy wrapper on github
* example2: Setting up Neel's PARalyzer 1.5 stable code from scratch, if time allows?
(you don't have to stay for that, but it will give you an idea of what you have to do)

# Version control

* manage your code
* keep track of all changes you make
    * with timestamps!
* no more fiddling with filenames
* revert changes
* merge fixes from collaborators
* keep a stable version when working on new features

# git
lives inside your project directory in a hidden directory: .git/
---
# Concepts
Rather than me putting together everything from scratch again, we will look at examples from the introduction at

http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/

## Learn the lingo!

* Repository (repo)
* Revision
* Check out / Pull
* Check in  / Commit
* Commit Message
* Branch
* Diff / Delta
* Merge
* Conflict

# 1st step
```bash
git init
```

# Two stage commit process
```bash
git add myscript.R # This is called staging
git add -A         # Stage all new & modified files

git commit -m "Initial commit of my awesome script"

git status

touch testdata.Rdata

git status
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        testdata.R

git push -u origin master # This will not push testdata.RData to the remote
```

# Github
* is a web-based Git repository hosting service

* Offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.

* Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration.

* It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as .red[wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests] for every project.

# Bitbucket

* Philipp uses it

* similar to github

* but allows private repos on their free plan
    * commercial, secret, NDA stuff

* you can also use mercurial (hg)

# (self-)hosted remote

* I asked MDC IT
---
# Things I left out

* adding ssh keys for easier interaction with github

* working on a project as a team
    * distributed (!) version control system

* Tagging

* keeping track of data?
    * git/hg do not work well with GB-sized (binary) files

# .gitignore

put all files you do not want to show up in git
```bash
cat .gitignore 
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
\*.Rproj
.gitignore
\*.swp
```
